# Tycho Indexer

![Tycho Indexer](./assets/tycho.png)

Tycho Indexer is a low-latency solution designed to track and update the state of onchain and offchain financial
protocols in real time. With Tycho, clients can subscribe to a stream of state update messages or query historical
states at any specific timestamp or block through an RPC interface.

Clients do not have to be aware of forks. In case the underlying chain experiences a fork, Tycho will automatically
resolve the fork and emit events. These events allow the clients to "revert" (through usual updates) to the correct
state immediately.

With Tycho, clients stay updated with the latest state of **all** protocols they are interested in. If they can handle
all, they can get all.

## How to Contribute

We warmly welcome open-source contributions!

**No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

The [tycho.build Telegram](https://t.me/+B4CNQwv7dgIyYTJl) is available for any questions you may have that are not
covered in this guide.

### Ways to contribute

You can contribute in three ways:

1. **Open an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug
   in Tycho, create a new issue in the issue tracker to report it.
2. **Add context:** Help resolve open issues by adding more context,
   such as screenshots and code snippets.
3. **Resolve an issue:** Open a pull request that fixes the issue, or demonstrates it's not an issue.

**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We encouarge you to participate in discussing issues and also to
participate in reviewing PRs.

### Opening a Pull Request

Please submit pull requests (PRs) targeting the main branch. Ensure all PR and commits titles follow the [Conventional Commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) using a prefix like `fix: bug XXX`. This prefix is essential for automatically incrementing the version number.

Please ensure the following commands pass if you have changed the code:

```
cargo clippy --workspace --lib --all-targets --all-features
cargo +nightly fmt --check
```

## Documentation

As Tycho is still in heavy development, the documentation can be a bit scattered.

The [Official Documentation](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho) is our
current best-effort attempt at keeping up-to-date information.

## Core Concepts:

#### Protocol Systems

A protocol system is a financial protocol defined by its swapping logic. Tycho indexes entire protocol systems, 
including dynamically created components. This means that components, such as Uniswap pools, which were not predetermined, 
are included in the indexing logic. They are automatically added and indexed upon their creation/detection.

#### Protocol Components

A Protocol Component represents an entity that facilitates the swapping of two tokens. A component consists of static
values that remain constant after creation. Separate to the _Protocol Component_ is the _Protocol Component State_.
_Protocol Component State_ tracks the dynamic values of the component, which Tycho uses to maintain a historical record.
For VM-based protocols, _Accounts_ (or Contracts) also link to the Protocol Component, and provides contract code and
storage values necessary for building historical states.

## Architecture

Tycho's architecture is designed to handle both real-time and historical data efficiently. Extractors process on-chain data,
which then propagate the data to clients and storage. Clients can access stored data with the RPC service,
and combine it with streamed deltas to reconstruct the current state of a protocol system.

![Tycho Flow Diagram](./assets/tycho_flow_diagram.png)

Tycho consists of several crates, each responsible for different aspects of the system:

- `tycho-common`: defines the common structs and traits used throughout the Tycho system. More detailed docs [here](./tycho-common/README.md).
- `tycho-indexer`: contains the main logic used to process incoming data and propogate the relevant information to clients and storage. Includes the RPC service. More detailed docs [here](./tycho-indexer/README.md).
- `tycho-storage`: manages the underlying database and provides gateways for data access. More detailed docs [here](./tycho-storage/README.md).
- `tycho-client`: a rust client to simplify the start-up and managing of data from a Tycho connection. More detailed docs [here](./tycho-client/README.md).
- `tycho-client-py`: a python interface for the rust client and RPC service. More detailed docs [here](./tycho-client-py/README.md).
- `tycho-ethereum`: a module that integrates Ethereum-specific blockchain functionalities into Tycho. More detailed docs [here](./tycho-ethereum/README.md).
